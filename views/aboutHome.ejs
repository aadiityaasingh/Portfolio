        I'm Aditya Singh — a full-stack developer who specializes in building fast,
        reliable, and user-focused web applications using the MERN stack. I enjoy
        creating products that solve real problems rather than just look good on paper.
        <br><br>
        I've built platforms across different domains including hiring, property rental,
        and security — handling everything from UI to authentication, API design,
        database modeling, and deployment.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I'm improving my backend architecture and system design skills while
        applying them to real projects. I'm always looking to collaborate on meaningful
        tech — especially in areas like scalable web platforms, AI-integrated solutions,
        and automation.
        <br><br>
        If it involves turning an idea into a polished working product, that’s where I
        perform best.
